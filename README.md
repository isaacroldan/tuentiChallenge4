Tuenti Challenge 4 Solutions
============================

My solutions to the problems of the 2014 hacking contest "Tuenti Challenge 4". 
All the code has comments (more or less)

I skipped 8, 10 and 14 and didn't have time to do 18, 19 and 20

[Challenge 18 - Power Password](https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges?id=18):
18 is not hard to do, just download the index.pyc, decompile it and will have the code the server is executing.
You have to calculate the discret logarithm of a big number, good luck with that, applying math modulus concepts shouln'd be hard :)
